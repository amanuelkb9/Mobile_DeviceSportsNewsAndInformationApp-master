`Mobile device Sports News and Information App`
Created an Android application centered on sports updates and details. Users can navigate through diverse sports categories, news, athletes, events, and historical records utilizing Google Material design elements like TabLayout, ViewPager2, and BottomNavigation. Within each section, a dynamic RecyclerView will be integrated, enabling users to seamlessly add new elements via the floatingActionButton Add(+).
